 * This file contains the JavaScript code to make the transit tracker display
 * data appropriately show arrival time estimates for Subway and Commuter Rail
 * services. Due to the current lack of Green Line prediction capabilities, we
 * are rolling our own headway display as well. 
 * 
 * Subway and Commuter Rail predictions must be done in separate functions
 * due to the fact that their respective data files are very different and 
 * require separate approaches to processing. However, the front-end shouldn't
 * have to worry about these differences, so a unified globally-accessible 
 * data structure is being implemented (called "lines").
 * 
 * The data for each "trip" is also made available in a globally-accessible
 * data structure called "trips", which is just a simple array with the 
 * name of the station and the predicted arrival time at said station for the
 * particular trip.
