/*
 * This is simply the sorted-by-destination version of masstrac.arrivals.
 * Each trip is placed into the structure based on its line and destination.
 * 
 * This structure is populated instead of masstrac.arrivals when sort-by-dest
 * is requested of the masstrac.sortArrivals( "dest" ) function is called.
 * 
 * It's broken down like so:
 *   masstrac.arrSorted.red
 *                            .a   // Ashmont trips
 *                            .b   // Braintree trips
 *                            .c   // Alewife trips
 *                     .orange
 *                            .f   // Forest Hills trips
 *                            .o   // Oak Grove trips
 *                     .blue
 *                            .b   // Bowdoin trips
 *                            .w   // Wonderland trips
 *                     .cr
 *                            .inb // Inbound trips (North/South Station)
 *                            .out // Outbound trips (Everything else)
 * 
 * Each of the above arrays (like masstrac.arrSorted.red.b) will contain the
 * exact same structure as the array entries of masstrac.arrivals[].
 * 
 * This isn't exactly very future proof, especially if any lines are ever
 * expanded, the underlying datagetter.js will need to be reworked to properly
 * sort the new arrivals. This structure also will not contain subway trips 
 * with different destinations (although in my experience with the data thus
 * far, the destinations have never been different than the terminal stations).

 * no predictions are available. As such, the data structures for the line
 * with predictions enabled are useless, so this simpler Green Line strucutre
 * is used as a stop-gap until predictions are available.
 * 
 * Example structure:
 * masstrac.greenLine[0] for North Station could look like:
 *     "Destination" : "Heath Street (E)",
 *     "Frequency"   : 11
 * 
 * This structure will be populated from the datagetter.js file using the
 * green.json structure's information, so be sure to include that first.
