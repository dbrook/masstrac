 * masstrac.arrivals[0] for, say, Park Street, could have:
 *     "Line"        : "red",
 *     "TripID"      : "R982ECD95",
 *     "Destination" : "Braintree",
 *     "Note"        : "Big Red",
 *     "Type"        : "pre",
 *     "Countdown"   : 5,
 *     "UNIXtime"    : 1360083280,

 * As detailed everywhere, the green line is a big mess signaling-wise, so
 * no predictions are available. As such, the data structures for the line
 * with predictions enabled are useless, so this simpler Green Line strucutre
 * is used as a stop-gap until predictions are available.
 * 
 * Example structure:
 * masstrac.greenLine[0] for North Station could look like:
 *     "Destination" : "Heath Street (E)",
 *     "Frequency"   : 11
 * 
 * This structure will be populated from the datagetter.js file using the
 * green.json structure's information, so be sure to include that first.

 * structure retrieved for a particular line. It's a simple array which

 *     predictions[0]
 *          "station"   : "Jackson Square",
 *          "countdown" : 5

 * The alerts array is a very simple structure that will get populated by

 * alerts.) For example, an alert for the Red Line would show up at Park 
 * Street, as would a broken elevator at Park Street.
 * Example entry within alerts:
 * masstrac.alerts[0]
 *          "title"   : "Park Street (808) lobby to Red Line center platform",
 *          "content" : "Park Street Elevator 808 is out of service. To ..."
