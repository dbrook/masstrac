      Description:
      This page will serve as the interface users will see after selecting a 
      station on the main page. The viewing options will be customizable in
      the next iteration (the beta version). For now, this page will display
      the data sorted by arrival time, more or less an exact replica (but 
      human-readable) of the underlying arrivals data structure. The output is
      a little too verbose for public consumption, but this is necessary as 
      the data's behavior continues to be examined.
    
      This page can be launched with the following parameters:
        name=Name of Station - The name of the station for which arrival times
                                should be loaded (the proper names come from 
                                the lib/stations.js file)
        times=on             - display the arrival times like "12:33pm"
        verbose=on           - don't use the condensed output, instead just
                                list the arriving trips sorted only by e.t.a.
        autoRef=on           - automatically request new data every 30 seconds
      
      All data is provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
      (MBTA) and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The
      arrival data is experimental and provided as-is, without any guarantee
      of its accuracy. Mass TRAC, nor its developers are affiliated with 
      MassDOT or the MBTA.

      Populating this page requires a healthy amount of JavaScript. First,
      the URL parameter(s) need to be isolated so the masstrac functions can
      properly do their job. 
      
      There is jQuery used throughout much of the page as well, so jQuery has
      to be included early on as well. 
      
      The structures.js contains initialization and details about the data
      structures the masstrac functions will use and/or populate while running.
      
      The stations.js file contains the list of all stations, what lines stop
      at each, what bus connections are available, and the lat/lon.
      
      The green.js file contains details about Green Line operations which is
      needed to overcome the lack of real-time data on the light rail side.
      
      The datagetter.js does much of the heavy lifting of asking for new data,
      sorting it (if desired), and looking up of alerts from the T's RSS feed.
      
      Finally, the ui.js file does much of the work of looking through what the
      masstrac functions have populated into the array[s] and displays that
      information for the user.
      
      And for real finally, the canvops.js file contains all the code for 
      plotting real-time station locations onto HTML5 canvas objects!

      is actually being displayed on the page. Put it into a jQuery UI dialog.
    -->
    <div id="disclaimer">
      <p>
        <b>Notice:</b> All data is provided by MassDOT and the Massachusetts
        Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The arrival predictions are based
        on experimental data and are offered "as-is" without any guarantee of
        accuracy.
      </p>
      <h3>What data is displayed?</h3>
      <p>
        Estimated arrival times appear in the left side of the window. Each one
        is associated with a train which is heading towards the listed 
        destination. The times listed are predictions as to how long you'll 
        have to wait for each of these trains to arrive
        at the station you have selected.
      </p>
      <h3>What do the colors indicate?</h3>
      <p>
        The color scheme was designed to communicate information easily for
        users as they become comfortable with the concept of Mass TRAC. Here's
        what they all mean:
      </p>
      <div class="sortArrival layout countdown scheduled">16 min</div>
      <b>Scheduled arrival</b>: there is no actual train associated with the listed
      arrival time but there soon will be. This
      is more common towards the ends of the lines, where a train is likely
      heading towards the terminal to turn around and will soon become the
      trip, making it change to 'predicted'.
      <p></p>
      <div class="sortArrival layout countdown predicted">12 min</div>
      <b>Predicted arrival</b>: there is an actual train operating associated
      with the displayed time. The arrival time is based directly off of
      its current position and velocity. 
      <p></p>
      <div class="sortArrival layout countdown approach">Approach</div>
      <b>Approaching</b>: The train is approaching the selected station. This is
      typically 2 minutes before it arrives.<br /><br />
      <p></p>
      <div class="sortArrival layout countdown arrive">Arriving</div>
      <b>Arriving</b>: The train is about to arrive or is at the platform of
      the selected station.<br /><br />
      <p></p>
      <div class="sortArrival layout countdown depart">Departing</div>
      <b>Departing / Boarding</b>: The train is currently stopped and about
      to leave the selected station.
    </div>
