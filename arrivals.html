      Description:
      This page will serve as the interface users will see after selecting a 
      station on the main page. The viewing options will be customizable in
      the next iteration (the beta version). For now, this page will display
      the data sorted by arrival time, more or less an exact replica (but 
      human-readable) of the underlying arrivals data structure. The output is
      a little too verbose for public consumption, but this is necessary as 
      the data's behavior continues to be examined.
      
      All data is provided by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
      (MBTA) and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The
      arrival data is experimental and provided as-is, without any guarantee
      of its accuracy. Mass TRAC, nor its developers are affiliated with 
      MassDOT or the MBTA.

      The main style sheet for this page is arrivals.css, but to keep a 
      consistent color scheme for the lines that use the MBTA's CSS colors,
      mbta_colors.css as a separate entity.

      Populating this page requires a healthy amount of JavaScript. First,
      the URL parameter(s) need to be isolated so the masstrac functions can
      properly do their job. 
      
      There is jQuery used throughout much of the page as well, so jQuery has
      to be included early on as well. 
      
      The structures.js contains initialization and details about the data
      structures the masstrac functions will use and/or populate while running.
      
      The stations.js file contains the list of all stations, what lines stop
      at each, what bus connections are available, and the lat/lon.
      
      The green.js file contains details about Green Line operations which is
      needed to overcome the lack of real-time data on the light rail side.
      
      The datagetter.js does much of the heavy lifting of asking for new data,
      sorting it (if desired), and looking up of alerts from the T's RSS feed.
      
      Finally, the ui.js file does much of the work of looking through what the
      masstrac functions have populated into the array[s] and displays that
      information for the user.

    <!--
      The body will be relatively simple without any data loaded into it. This
      page is generated dynamically, so much of the structure is built after 
      the data requests are made.

    <!--
      First set up the heading / title bar area that will house some controls:
       - Title bar with Mass TRAC logo / name on the left
       - Manual refresh button w/ Time of last refresh next to it
       - On the right, have a series of status icons:
          - Bus connection indicator (drop down ... jQuery UI needed)
          - Alerts exist indicator icon (a drop down as well)
          - Automatic refresh mode indicator
       - And finally a settings button
