      Description:
      This page will serve as a simple launcher to let users select the version
      of Mass TRAC they'd prefer to use: the mobile or desktop optimized site.

    Default to jQuery mobile because it looks great on the desktop too, but 
    will also make the page the most accessible, since we aren't really
    "guaranteed" a user preference at this stage.

      <p>
        Mass TRAC is an application that provides users of the MBTA with
        a quick way to see how long they'll have to wait for a train.

        Before selecting a station, choose the interface that's right for you:

      <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">

        <!--
          Why the disabling of AJAX? Well, be default a jQuery Mobile site
          will use AJAX to fetch other pages, thus rendering them on this page,
          in its own magical mobile way. However, for selecting the next page,
          this is very undesirable behavior (it screws up the desktop version).
        -->
        <li><a href="masstrac.html" data-ajax="false">Desktop / Laptop</a></li>
        <li><a href="mselectindex.html" data-ajax="false">Smartphone / Tablet</a></li>
      </ul>
