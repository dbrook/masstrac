      <h3>Data Overview</h3>
      <p>
        All of the arrival times are all calculated by the data provider (the
        MBTA and MassDOT), and Mass TRAC renders it in a more human-readable 
        form. <b>MassDOT, the MBTA, and the Mass TRAC authors are not
        responsible</b> for any inaccuracies or issues that arise because of 
        inaccuracies with the live data (read below for known bugs).
      </p>
      <p>
        The data being displayed is quite simple. When you see a time 
        listed next to a destination, it indicates how long you 
        can expect to wait for a train <b>going towards that destination</b> to
        show up <b>at the station you selected</b>. Fresh data can be fetched
        manually by pressing the &quot;Refresh&quot; button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any service alerts found that affect the lines that stop at the 
        station selected are also rendered and counted for your convenience.
        Additionally, if you click one of the trips, you can see all the
        associated predictions with it (how long it will take to run its route)!
      </p>
      <h3>Scheduled Times</h3>
      <p>
        Listings with &quot;Sched.&quot; appended in front of their countdowns
        are based on provided schedule data from the MBTA. These predictions
        are for trains which haven't yet turned around at the end of the line
        and made the trip in the direction listed. For example, a Forest Hills
        train will become an Oak Grove train after it's reversed at Forest
        Hills.
      </p>
      <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
      <p>
        As we've developed Mass TRAC and tested data against it, we've come 
        across some strange (and sometimes persistent) bugs that could affect
        the usefulness of the tool. Below are the biggest ones we've found.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the bugs we encountered were with the Commuter Rail feeds, and
        as of April 25, 2013, the MBTA completely revamped how those feeds were
        generated. So we'll need some time to find <b>new</b> bugs!
