      <h3>Data Overview</h3>
      <p>
        All of the arrival times are all calculated by the data provider (the
        MBTA and MassDOT), and Mass TRAC renders it in a more human-readable 
        form. <b>MassDOT, the MBTA, and the Mass TRAC authors are not
        responsible</b> for any inaccuracies or issues that arise because of 
        inaccuracies with the live data (read below for known bugs).
      </p>
      <p>
        The data being displayed is quite simple. When you see a time 
        listed next to a destination, it indicates how long you 
        can expect to wait for a train <b>going towards that destination</b> to
        show up <b>at the station you selected</b>. Fresh data can be fetched
        manually by pressing the &quot;Refresh&quot; button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any service alerts found that affect the lines that stop at the 
        station selected are also rendered and counted for your convenience.
        Additionally, if you click one of the trips, you can see all the
        associated predictions with it (how long it will take to run its route)!
      </p>
      <h3>The times in (parentheses)</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the smaller screens on mobile devices, certain shortcuts were
        taken to provide information in a clearer manner. The result of this is
        that the distinction between a <b>predicted trip</b> (one that's already 
        running) and a <b>scheduled trip</b> (generally one that hasn't gotten 
        to the end of the line and turned around yet) is 
        denoted with the countdown times in parentheses.
      </p>
      <h3>Known Bugs</h3>
      <p>
        As we've developed Mass TRAC and tested data against it, we've come 
        across some strange (and sometimes persistent) bugs that could affect
        the usefulness of the tool. Below are the biggest ones we've found.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Weekend Commuter Rail Data: </b>
          The MBTA data feed seems to get polluted (mostly on weekends) with
          phantom weekday trips that will obviously never come by. That's why
          we print the Train # on Commuter Rail trips!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Loss of Tracking Data: </b>
          On the Commuter Rail feeds, trips will sometimes lose their tracking
          data (which includes the real-time position and other information), 
          which takes it from predicted mode to scheduled mode and back again.
          This reverts the times to whatever was printed on the schedule and 
          thus won't (necessarily) reflect reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Feed Resilience: </b>
          Things happen, sometimes the tracking data feeds disappear for a few
          minutes here and there. If one is encountered, Mass TRAC will tell 
          you.
        </li>
