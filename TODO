Mass TRAC - Features not yet implemented
========================================

 The masstrac.* Data Acquisition API
-------------------------------------
  - Switch from synchronous to asynchronous AJAX operations
      + Browser locks up as calls to the PHP and retrieval of JSON data from
        the cached server copies are happening (AJAX in synchronous mode).
      + This could be tough because of how the JSON data is processed,
        perhaps we should refactor the code a little bit to use the jQuery
        $.ajaxStop() handler? (Admittedly a better understanding of AJAX 
        would better facilitate this ... an area for more research)

  - Refactor lines so that their full names can be queried.

 Mobile Site
-------------
  - Canvas widget will require some work to display on different sized screens

  - Ideally the whole thing would use the AJAX navigation properly, so the
    ins and outs of that would need to be learned before a solid mobile site
    could be developed. The separated approach works now, however.

 Arrival Information Page
--------------------------
  - HTML5 Canvas loading PNG images on webkit browsers is troublesome.
      + Still have to find out why.
