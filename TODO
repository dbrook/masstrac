Mass TRAC - Features not yet implemented
========================================

 Data Acquisition
------------------
  - Error handling                                                          DONE
      + Sending failure status from PHP to AJAX and properly handling them
      + Notify users that an error occurred via the interface
  
  - Streamline the alert data acquisition                                   DONE
      + Currently it requires pegging the PHP script for EACH service, and
        is hugely wasteful from a parsing perspective (the poor browsers!)
      + Going to switch to a single function call that will encapsulate loops.
  
  - Switch from synchronous to asynchronous AJAX operations                 OMIT
      + Browser locks up as calls to the PHP and retrieval of JSON data from
        the cached server copies are happening (AJAX in synchronous mode).
      + This could be tough because of how the JSON data is processed,
        perhaps we should refactor the code a little bit to use the jQuery
        $.ajaxStop() handler? (Admittedly a better understanding of AJAX 
        would better facilitate this ... an area for more research)
      + Flagged "OMIT" because the data acquisition is so much quicker now it
        really doesn't matter.

 Launch Page
-------------
  - Slight modifications in content layout
      + On low-res screens, the heading is extremely large. Perhaps redesign
        page such that on low-res screens it's not as big and users can see
        the entire page and not have this awkward scrolling accordion area
        within the scrolling main page.

  - Alerts on the main launch page?
      + A mechanism to show the alerts on the front page would be cool, but
        there's a significant problem of information overload and probably
        no clear way to rectify that.

  - Favorite stations
      + Let users save stations for quick access. Note however that our URLs
        are constructed in a totally "bookmarkable" manner.

 Mobile Site
-------------
  - Make the mobile site
      + Any issues so far?

 Arrival Information Page
--------------------------
  - Settings dialog                                                         DONE
      + A basic version is now done, but if more features are needed we'll
        have to evaluate the available time.

  - HTML5 Canvas showing currently-tracked train positions                  DONE
      + Only does rapid transit lines, and as it turns out, only the last
        known positions are reported with the lat, lon fields. It appears that
        when a train passes a signal, it's location is recorded and that's why
        the little position arrows don't ever display in places other than
        around the station stops. Still, it's kind of neat.

  - Organization of arrival data
      + Group-by-destination is now the default, but it's a little messy, as we
        cannot nicely group trips that have destinations other than their
        terminals. One option would be to process these like the Commuter Rail
        outbound trips and just list them by time.

  - Automatic Data Refreshing / Updating                                    DONE
      + Make the auto refresh button trigger the timer structure to request new
        data from the servers without user intervention.
      + This still needs to reworking to operate as expected.

  - COOKIES. How, what, why?                                                OMIT
      + As we're now past the feature freeze, whatever is done is done, the
        focus is now in getting working what we have.
