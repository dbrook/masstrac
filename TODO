Mass TRAC - Features not yet implemented
========================================

 Data Acquisition
------------------
  - Error handling
      + Sending failure status from PHP to AJAX and properly handling them
      + Notify users that an error occurred via the interface
  
  - Switch from synchronous to asynchronous AJAX operations
      + Browser locks up as calls to the PHP and retrieval of JSON data from
        the cached server copies are happening (AJAX in synchronous mode).
        
      + This could be tough because of how the JSON data is processed,
        perhaps we should refactor the code a little bit to use the jQuery
        $.ajaxStop() handler? (Admittedly a better understanding of AJAX 
        would better facilitate this ... an area for more research)

 Launch Page
-------------
  - Slight modifications in content layout
      + On low-res screens, the heading is comically large. Perhaps redesign
        page such that on low-res screens it's not as big and users can see
        the entire page and not have this awkward scrolling accordion area
        within the scrolling main page.

  - Alerts on the main launch page?
      + A mechanism to show the alerts on the front page would be cool, but
        there's a significant problem of information overload and probably
        no clear way to implement this.

  - Favorite stations
      + Let users save stations for quick access. Note however that our URLs
        are constructed in a totally "bookmarkable" manner.

 Mobile Site
-------------
  - Make the mobile site.

 Arrival Information Page
--------------------------
  - Settings dialog
      + jQuery UI to make a dialog or something hidden by default. When user
        clicks the settings icon, simply display it. We'll need cookies to
        save these options on the users' computers!
      + Project proposal details our desired configuration parameters.

  - HTML5 Canvas showing currently-tracked train positions
      + I think we should only attempt this with the subway lines, not the
        Commuter Rail, which would look very uninteresting.
      + This should be reasonably "interesting" to accomplish, but would 
        definitely add some wow factor to the site.

  - Organization of arrival data
      + The data-dump style currently used in the Alpha stage is somewhat
        silly in its current form, especially where only one line serves a 
        stations, like Harvard Square, where all the tables will show "RD".
      + A better way to display might be to group trips to the same destination
        under a heading, and then a simple table (or whatever, list...) with
        the countdowns for each of them.

... if you think of more, please just add to this file and recommit! Thanks
